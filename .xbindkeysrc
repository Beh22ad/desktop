# xbindkeys configuration #
###########################
#
# Version: 1.8.6
#
# This file is adapted for BunsenLabs Linux.
#

# NOTE: There is a gui available for editing keybinds - 'xbindkeys-config'.
# However we don't recommend its installation and use because it has some bugs.

# The format of a command line is:
#    "command to start"
#       associated key
#

# To identify a key, you can run 'xbindkeys --key' or
# 'xbindkeys --multikey' in a terminal
# and put one of the two output lines in this file.

# List of modifiers:
#   Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock),
#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll).
#
# Mod4 is also known as the Super or Windows key.
#
# The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can
# use it if you want to catch release events instead of press events.
#
# By default, xbindkeys does not pay attention to the modifiers
# NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock.
# Uncomment the lines below if you want to pay attention to them.
#
#keystate_numlock = enable
#keystate_capslock = enable
#keystate_scrolllock= enable

# NOTE xbindkeys reloads its configuration file each time it has changed.
# If you want to force it to reload its configuration file,
# you can send a HUP signal:
#
#       killall -HUP xbindkeys
#
# Or if that's not enough, a full restart:
#
#       pkill -x xbindkeys
#       xbindkeys_autostart
#
# (Sometimes this is needed.)
# When a HUP signal is sent to xbindkeys,
# changes in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc take effect only after moving the mouse.

# See 'man xbindkeys' for more information.
